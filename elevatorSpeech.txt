My name is Alejandro Londono and I am a recent
 engineering graduate that is refocusing in Software and development
 and I have studied design.
 in my previous position as a jr. front end web developer
 I focused on the automated development processes
 so that my team could work more quickly and efficiently.
the boilerplate and CLI's that I wrote increased productivity in our department 3X
I am really great at Idea generation, colaboration
 and taking a lean or minimalistic approach to a problem.
I have a desire to be sort of an evangelist for software and development
do you have any advice on how I can acomplish this goal?
